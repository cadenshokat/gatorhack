// - redactText / uiLabel: pattern redaction for text that must stay readable (Jev labels, "Explain" passages).
//   Personal details become placeholders: [email], [link], [handle], [phone number], [card number], [id number],
//   [account number], [rx number], [date], [address], [amount], [dose], [medication], [number], [name], [secret].
// - allowlistWords: a vocabulary allowlist for the outline the generative model sees. Any run of words outside a
//   bundled interface vocabulary becomes one '·'; digits become value shapes ([price], [date], [number] ...).
// stillSensitive is the server's last check: true when something that looks personal survived.
//
// Small plain numbers (1-3 digits: "2 refills", "up to 1 business day", "4:30 PM") are kept on purpose: they are
// not personal, and explanations must keep them. Digit runs of 4 or more become [number].
